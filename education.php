                    <P>Plato was a philosopher, as well as mathematician, in Classical Greece once said "The direction in which education starts a man will determine his future in life."</P>
                    <P>ORG also aims to educate the deprived farmers children as in order to make them free to decide their own future. Even though there are many schools in the village, but they are not well equipped to built the next generation Digital Farmer. The foundation would provide these schools with 2 laptops and internet system, making the village children more socially connected to media and be part of the main goal of ORG to digitalize the agriculture sector.</P>
                    <P>This digitalization would motivate children to come to school and gather knowledge and prevent dropouts.</P>
