                    <P>ORG aims to cover all ORG members by the ORG home care facilities. An accidental death of a member will allow an amount of BDT- 100000 (One hundred thousand) to the spouse/nominee of the late ORG member. ORG will assist the family to recipe an investment plan that promises smooth maintenance and financial stability of the family. For example, the family can purchase 6 rickshaws (each rickshaw costing Tk-15,000 X 6= 90,000). Depending on the locality, the family may earn a monthly amount of Tk-18,000 rent from the rickshaws while still holding Tk-10,000 in the bank. Covering all monetary requirements, these families need approximately Tk-6,000 monthly. With such expense management, the family can buy another new Rickshaw every 33 days. So within a year that family might be the owner to another 12 rickshaws.</P>
                    <P>In the 2nd year family will have monthly rental income of TK-54,000. This is how our ORG family will grow and expand till no one is under poverty. Banking systems will be regularly used and practiced among these people.</P>
