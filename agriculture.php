                    <P>The farmers of this country are the most essential part of the agricultural sector, they work day and night making the country GDP growth rate above 5 percent, but the paradox is they are the ones living in extreme poverty.</P>
                    <p>This harsh reality could be changed by SED through Technology they would be self independent and rely on the internet. SED would eliminate high interest loan from money lenders for farming and provide a self reliant living for the farmers and remove the farmers debt. These improvements of the farmerâ€™s lifestyle would lead to the improvement of the agriculture sector of our country even more.</p>

                    <P>Usually after the cultivation the agricultural workers are sitting idle without being paid, ORG will employ farmers round the year. Example encouraging them to work in all-season crops , engaging them in indigenous crafts, creating awareness in community based developments; hence giving the poor farmers to make decent living throughout the years.</P>
                    <P>ORG would also provide safety and security for the fishermen and their family, by registering all fishermen as members of ORG. As members they would have the following benefits.</P>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Safety maintenance for the fishing boat, with identification number of each boat.</li>
                    <li>Every member would have ID Card.</li>
                    <li>Fishermen and their family members will be under insurance program, which would cover their hospitalization, accidental death coverage for family, boat replacement and repair etc.</li>

                    <P>The farmers would also be trained with required IT education to reach their local and foreign buyers and spread their product availability by their own, thus the middle man is eliminated.</P>
                    <P>They would sell the products in right price hence ORG would provide full marketing support and allow them to get the beneficial directly. As a result within a short time each village would be in the shape of self independence.</P>

                    <P>A large number of water bodies, mainly ponds are infested with unhygienic and 

unusable water in the rural communities of Bangladesh. Due to the unsanitary 

water conditions, these puddles and ponds spread water carried diseases. Water 

borne diseases like diarrhea, dengue and dysentery are some of the major causes 

of ill health and death among the children of these communities. And we, ORG 

Foundation Bangladesh, aim to rectify the afore-mentioned problems surrounding 

water bodies in rural areas by using our most popular resources, farmers and fish 

cultivators, by changing these water bodies from disease hubs to key livelihood 

supporters.</P>
                    <p> ORG Foundation Bangladesh intends to put emphasize on this matter for the

betterment of our country and as well as global respect. </p>
                    <P>Our main objects of work are stated bellow:-</P>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Purifying the water of these surface water bodies adequately for fish

cultivation, agriculture and for regular household usage.</li></ul>
